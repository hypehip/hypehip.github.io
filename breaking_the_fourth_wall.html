                <!--p>Detailed look into the latest trends in moving away from desktop/browser/handheld apps and into the messaging apps/channels. People at large seem to be more inclined to get things done by chatting with friends/family/coworkers, and also with third party software (i.e. bots), than they are inclined to log into their browser or mobile app. At the end of the session we demonstrate how to build your own conversational bot to enable conversational commerce.</p-->
